# Section 3.3: Business Habitat Mapping

## Overview
This section applies Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) principles to analyze business success probability based on environmental factors and patterns from successful businesses in Wisconsin. Using data from {sample_size} businesses across multiple industries, this analysis provides predictive insights into location suitability for specific business types.

## 3.3.1 Habitat Analysis Methodology

### Species Distribution Modeling Approach
- **Training Data**: Successful businesses operating beyond industry-specific thresholds
- **Environmental Variables**: Demographics, traffic, accessibility, competition, site characteristics
- **MaxEnt Algorithm**: Calculates success probability based on similarity to successful locations
- **Validation**: Cross-validation with known successful and unsuccessful businesses

### Success Thresholds by Business Type
- **Restaurants**: 3+ years of operation
- **Hair Salons**: 2+ years of operation
- **Auto Repair Shops**: 3+ years of operation
- **Retail Clothing Stores**: 4+ years of operation
- **Gyms/Fitness Centers**: 2+ years of operation

### Analysis Parameters
