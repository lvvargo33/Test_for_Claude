**NOTE:** Competitive analysis data is now collected separately and comprehensively analyzed in Section 2.1 of the report using the Universal Competitive Analysis Framework. This template focuses on site-specific physical characteristics and neighborhood context.

**COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS INTEGRATION:** Section 2.1 uses automated Google Places data analysis with universal_competitive_analyzer.py to identify direct, similar, and general competition within 1, 3, and 5-mile radii. The system automatically detects "service desert" scenarios and calculates market opportunity scores (0-100).
