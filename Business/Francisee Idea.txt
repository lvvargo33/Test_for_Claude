### Restaurant Foot Traffic Estimation Methodology

**Step 1: Gather Basic Information**
- **Location details:** Address, square footage, restaurant type
- **Physical capacity:** Calculate using industry standards (10-15 sq ft per person)
- **Operating capacity:** Multiply by 85-90% for realistic maximum

**Step 2: Google Popular Times Analysis**
- **Identify peak periods:** Find when Google shows "very busy" or "as busy as it gets"
- **Map weekly patterns:** Note busy periods across all days
- **Screenshot data:** Save for reference and client reporting

**Step 3: Phone Call Calibration**
- **Call during peak Google busy time**
- **Ask:** "What's the wait time for a table?" (or takeout time for fast food)
- **Convert to capacity:**
  - No wait = 50% capacity
  - 15-20 min wait = 75% capacity
  - 20+ min wait = 85% capacity
- **Validate:** Call multiple times for consistency

**Step 4: Establish Scaling Formula**
```
Peak Occupancy = Operating Capacity × Wait Time Factor
Google Baseline = This peak occupancy becomes your "100% busy"
Scale other periods: Occupancy = Peak × (Google Busy Level ÷ 100%)
```

**Step 5: Traffic Pattern Development**
- **Apply scaling:** Use Google's relative busy levels for all time periods
- **Calculate daily traffic:** Account for turnover rates and operating hours
- **Conservative estimates:** Use 1.5-2.0 turnover for casual dining

**Step 6: Revenue Estimation (Optional)**
- **Analyze competitor menus:** Calculate average check amounts
- **Apply formula:** Daily Customers × Average Check = Daily Revenue
- **Validate:** Cross-check with industry sales per square foot benchmarks

**Step 7: Client Reporting**
- **Present ranges:** "Estimated 250-320 daily customers" (±25% confidence)
- **Focus on comparisons:** "Location A shows 40% higher traffic than Location B"
- **Include methodology:** Brief explanation of data sources and approach

**Accuracy Expectations:**
- **Individual estimates:** ±25-30% accuracy
- **Comparative analysis:** High confidence for relative differences
- **Best use:** Site selection and competitive positioning (not precise financial projections)

- **Annual Operating**: $24K-36K
- **Marketing/Sales**: $12K-18K (networking events, content creation, advertising)
- **Total Year 1 Expenses**: $44K-66K

**Year 1 Net Profit**: $76K-104K

### Revenue Expansion Opportunities

**Immediate Add-Ons to Core Service:**

**Higher-Value Service Extensions:**

- **Market Entry Strategy** ($5,000-10,000): Full market opportunity analysis for businesses entering new cities
- **Site Selection + Buildout Planning** ($7,500): Partner with contractors to provide complete location-to-opening service
- **Due Diligence for Business Acquisitions** ($3,000-8,000): Analyze existing business locations for potential buyers

**Recurring Revenue Streams:**
- **Market Intelligence Subscription** ($200-500/month): Monthly market updates for active franchise operators
- **Location Performance Dashboard** ($150/month): Ongoing traffic and performance monitoring for existing clients
- **Expansion Planning Retainer** ($1,000/month): For growing franchise operators who want ongoing expansion consulting

**Partnership Revenue Opportunities:**
- **Referral fees from business brokers** (10-15% of their commission)
- **Finder's fees from lenders** ($500-1,500 per successful loan referral)
- **Kickbacks from contractors/vendors** (5-10% of project value)
- **White-label services for real estate firms** ($1,500-3,000 per report)

### Revenue Optimization Strategy

Focus your first 6 months on proving the core service works, then systematically add higher-value services:

- **Months 1-6**: Perfect the basic location analysis, build case studies
- **Months 7-12**: Add lease negotiation and performance monitoring services  
- **Year 2**: Launch multi-location and market entry services for proven clients
- **Year 3**: Develop subscription/retainer services for recurring revenue

The key is to start narrow (basic location analysis) but think expansively about what other location-related problems your clients face. Every business decision they make after choosing a location could potentially become a service you offer.

Your biggest opportunity is probably the franchise angle - successful franchise operators need multiple analyses and have bigger budgets. Landing 2-3 multi-unit franchise operators as clients could easily generate $50K+ annually just from them.
